This repository was developed using [openai-node](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) and based on [openai-quickstart-node](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-node), with several additional elements added.

- Supports styled-components and TypeScript
- Remember conversation context instead of one-time responses
- More intuitive and clean UI with easy customization options
